Question,Answer
What is a rational number?,"A rational number is any number that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, where the denominator is not zero. In other words, a rational number is of the form p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0."
What is the difference between a rational number and an irrational number?,"A rational number is any number that can be expressed as a fraction (p/q) where p and q are integers, and q ≠ 0. Rational numbers can have terminating or repeating decimal expansions. An irrational number, on the other hand, cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers, and its decimal expansion is non-terminating and non-repeating (e.g., √2, π)."
What is the additive inverse of a rational number?,"The additive inverse of a rational number is the number that, when added to the original number, gives the sum of zero. For example, the additive inverse of 7/9 is -7/9 because 7/9 + (-7/9) = 0."
Is the sum of two rational numbers always rational?,"Yes, the sum of two rational numbers is always rational. This is because the sum of two fractions can always be written as a fraction with integers in the numerator and denominator, where the denominator is not zero."
Can a rational number have a terminating decimal expansion?,"Yes, a rational number can have a terminating decimal expansion. This occurs when the denominator of the fraction (in its simplest form) has only 2 and/or 5 as its prime factors. For example, 1/8 = 0.125, which is a terminating decimal."
Can a rational number have a repeating decimal expansion?,"Yes, a rational number can have a repeating decimal expansion. This occurs when the denominator of the fraction (in its simplest form) has prime factors other than just 2 and 5. For example, 1/3 = 0.333..., which is a repeating decimal."
Is -5/9 a rational number? Explain.,"Yes, -5/9 is a rational number because it can be expressed as the fraction -5/9, where both -5 (numerator) and 9 (denominator) are integers, and the denominator is not zero."
What is the decimal representation of 5/8?,"The decimal representation of 5/8 is 0.625. This is a terminating decimal."
What is the relationship between rational numbers and integers?,"All integers are rational numbers because they can be expressed as a fraction with a denominator of 1. For example, 3 can be written as 3/1, which is a rational number."
What is the multiplicative inverse of a rational number?,"The multiplicative inverse (or reciprocal) of a rational number is the number that, when multiplied by the original number, gives the product of 1. For example, the multiplicative inverse of 3/5 is 5/3, because (3/5) * (5/3) = 1."

What is a rational number?,"A rational number is any number that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, where the denominator is not zero. For example, 3/4 is a rational number because it is the ratio of two integers, 3 and 4. Rational numbers also include integers (like -2, 0, and 5) since they can be written as fractions like -2/1, 0/1, and 5/1."
What are examples of rational numbers?,"Examples of rational numbers include: 1/2, -4/7, 3 (which can be written as 3/1), and 0 (which can be written as 0/1). Even repeating decimals like 0.333... (1/3) and terminating decimals like 0.25 (1/4) are rational numbers."
What is an irrational number?,"An irrational number is a number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. Its decimal form is non-terminating and non-repeating. Examples include √2, π, and e. These numbers cannot be written as fractions."
What is the difference between a rational number and an irrational number?,"The main difference is that rational numbers can be written as fractions (p/q) where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0, while irrational numbers cannot be expressed as such fractions. Rational numbers have either terminating or repeating decimals, whereas irrational numbers have non-terminating, non-repeating decimals."
What is the additive inverse of a rational number?,"The additive inverse of a rational number is a number that, when added to the original number, results in zero. For example, the additive inverse of 7/9 is -7/9 because 7/9 + (-7/9) = 0."
What is the multiplicative inverse of a rational number?,"The multiplicative inverse (or reciprocal) of a rational number is a number that, when multiplied by the original number, results in one. For example, the multiplicative inverse of 3/5 is 5/3 because (3/5) × (5/3) = 1."
Is the sum of two rational numbers always rational?,"Yes, the sum of two rational numbers is always rational. This is because adding two fractions results in another fraction with integers in the numerator and denominator, provided the denominator is not zero. For example, 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2, which is rational."
Can the product of two rational numbers be irrational?,"No, the product of two rational numbers is always rational. For example, (2/3) × (4/5) = 8/15, which is rational."
Can a rational number have a terminating decimal?,"Yes, a rational number can have a terminating decimal if, in its simplest form, the denominator has only 2 and/or 5 as its prime factors. For example, 1/8 = 0.125."
Can a rational number have a repeating decimal?,"Yes, a rational number can have a repeating decimal if its denominator (in simplest form) contains prime factors other than 2 or 5. For example, 1/3 = 0.333..., where 3 is a repeating decimal."
What is the relationship between rational numbers and integers?,"All integers are rational numbers because they can be expressed as fractions with a denominator of 1. For instance, the integer 4 can be written as 4/1, which is a rational number."
How do you represent 1/2 on a number line?,"To represent 1/2 on a number line: 1. Find the space between 0 and 1. 2. Divide this space into two equal parts since the denominator is 2. 3. The point halfway between 0 and 1 represents 1/2."

How do you compare two rational numbers?,"To compare two rational numbers, first express them with a common denominator. Then compare the numerators. For example, to compare 2/3 and 3/5, rewrite them as 10/15 and 9/15. Since 10 > 9, 2/3 > 3/5."
What are the closure properties of rational numbers?,"Rational numbers are closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (except division by zero). This means that performing any of these operations on two rational numbers will always result in a rational number."
How do you simplify a rational number?,"To simplify a rational number, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). For example, to simplify 8/12, divide both by 4 (their GCD) to get 2/3."
What are some real-life examples of rational numbers?,"Real-life examples of rational numbers include: dividing a pizza into equal parts (e.g., 1/8 slice), measuring distances (e.g., 1/2 km), and representing money (e.g., $1.25 = 125/100)."
What happens when you divide a rational number by another rational number?,"Dividing a rational number by another rational number (except by zero) results in another rational number. For example, (1/2) ÷ (3/4) = (1/2) × (4/3) = 4/6 = 2/3, which is rational."
What is the decimal representation of 5/8?,"The decimal representation of 5/8 is 0.625. This is a terminating decimal because the denominator (8) has only 2 as its prime factor."
